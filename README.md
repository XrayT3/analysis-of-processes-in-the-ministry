# Analysis of processes in the ministry
How many people should be recruited into the new department?

## Probelm
You are a data analyst for a ministry and have been asked to analyze data from a process evaluation of workers at the local level.
The timeframe for an office to respond to a benefit application is typically 30 days. Until now, the Department has mainly monitored compliance with this deadline. 
It has never centrally addressed whether and how benefits are administered procedurally. This has been left to the local level.

**Goal:** In a month we will open recruitment for a team to handle the process centrally. Need to find out how many people will need to be recruited before the start?

**Outputs:**
- Code for data transformation
- Power BI data report and short presentation
